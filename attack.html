                <p>Attack ON Titans</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Attack on Titan, also known as Shingeki no Kyojin in Japanese, is a dark fantasy manga and anime series created by Hajime Isayama. The story is set in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to the existence of gigantic humanoid creatures called Titans.
<br>
                  The series primarily follows the story of Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert. They live within the walls of a city known as Paradis, which is surrounded by massive walls that protect them from the Titans. However, their peaceful existence is shattered when a colossal Titan breaches the outer wall, allowing smaller Titans to invade and wreak havoc on the city.
                  <br>
                  Driven by a desire for revenge and a determination to protect humanity, Eren enlists in the military and joins the elite squad known as the Survey Corps. The Survey Corps' main mission is to venture outside the walls and explore the world beyond, as well as to fight against the Titans.
                  <br>
                  As the story progresses, mysteries surrounding the Titans, the origin of the walls, and the truth about the history of humanity are gradually unveiled. The narrative delves into complex themes such as survival, freedom, discrimination, and the dark nature of humanity itself.
                  <br>
                  Attack on Titan is known for its intense and visceral action sequences, as the humans employ advanced mobility gear to navigate and fight the Titans. The gear allows them to swing through the environment using gas-powered grappling hooks and blades to strike at the Titans' weak points.
                  <br>
                  The anime adaptation of Attack on Titan premiered in 2013 and concluded its fourth and final season in 2021. The final season is divided into two parts, with the second part set to release in early 2023. The anime faithfully adapts the manga's storyline and has garnered critical acclaim for its animation, storytelling, and character development.
                  <br>
                  Attack on Titan has captivated audiences around the world with its intricate plot twists, morally complex characters, and thought-provoking themes. It has been praised for its ability to blend action, horror, and political intrigue to create a compelling and suspenseful narrative.
                  <br>
                  It's worth noting that my knowledge cutoff is in September 2021, so there may have been new developments or story arcs in Attack on Titan beyond that point. To get the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking reliable sources and websites dedicated to the series.</p>
